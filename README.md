Trippy mobile app is a project specifically designed for Android development course at Conestoga College for Fall 2021 semester. Our group have put all efforts in bringing an application which has simple, 
intuitive interface based on Material Design principles in Android studio.

The app allows users to login into the application to view available hotels. It also allows the user to view different type of rooms available. Users can book different type of rooms they want on the basis of their preferences. They can also search for hotels at nearby locations. 
The payment method provides users a secure way to pay their bills.

Our main goal wasnâ€™t only about basic functionality of app but it must be packed with features that would be the icing on the cake for users.

The first priority is to make secure login so that during particular session the the app is confined to only single user.

The user can choose from pre defined suggested list of hotels.

While booking a hotel, a user is provided to change check in and checkout, choose room type, facilities available and search hotel on map.

Specifications :

The application works by processing secure online reservations of hotels by signing in from google account

In a detail page of hotel users can choose number of guest,  room type  and stay period from Date range picker

Google map API was used to search the nearby hotels and to find the distance from current location

SQLite was implemented at backend to store data after reservation was done by the user

At checkout the user has two options for payment either by validating card details or by generating QR code
